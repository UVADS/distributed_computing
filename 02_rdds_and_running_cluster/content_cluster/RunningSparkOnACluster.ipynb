    "\n",
    "One benefit of Spark is the ability to scale computation by adding more machines and running in cluster mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The *workers* (which have *executors*) receive code and data chunks and do the processing, sending results back to driver\n",
    "\n",
    "The *driver* is in charge of coordinating the workers\n",
    "\n",
    "Driver + Workers = Spark application\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spark breaks large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks called *partitions*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Driver program builds a *Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)* of entire computation. This graph represents sequence of operations and transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAG optimized by Spark's query optimizer, then DAG scheduler breaks job down into sequence of stages and tasks. Each stage is a set of parallelizable tasks that can be run without shuffling (redistributing) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Driver assigns tasks to executors running on the worker nodes. Goal is to execute tasks on the worker node that has the data partition it needs, minimizing data movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tasks are executed in parallel on worker nodes, with each task processing a single partition of data\n",
    "\n",
    "- For actions that return a result to the driver (like `collect()`), the results from the individual tasks are collected and aggregated\n"
