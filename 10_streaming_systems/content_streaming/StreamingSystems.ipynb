    "\n",
    "Streaming systems reference *exactly-once processing*, meaning that every record is processed exactly once.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, no guarantees were made about record processing; they were on a *best efforts* basis.  \n",
    "Records might be duplicated, producing incorrect aggregations.  \n",
    "If a machine crashed, aggregations might be lost, and records might need to be processed more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Apache Beam` ensures that records are not erroneously dropped or duplicated.  \n",
    "The user can configure how long the system should wait for late data.  \n",
    "Any records arriving later than this deadline are dropped.  \n",
    "This feature leads to potential inaccuracy, but assures that all records showing up on time for processing are accurately processed exactly once.  \n",
    "Late records are explicitly dropped.\n",
